This Python script is designed to scrape and display the top 10 news headlines from the "Briefs" section of the Times of India website. It begins by importing the necessary libraries â€” `requests` to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` module to parse the HTML content. The script sends an HTTP GET request to the URL `https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/briefs` while including a user-agent header to mimic a real web browser and avoid being blocked. Once the page is successfully retrieved, it uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and locate all `<h2>` tags, which typically contain the news headlines on that page. The script then extracts the text content from each of these tags, filters out any empty results, and prints the first 10 headlines in a numbered format. This provides a quick and automated way to view the latest news updates from the Times of India.
